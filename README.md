# Neonatal Sleep Patterns' Impact Analysis Based on EEG Signals

This repository contains the research into neonatal sleep patterns' impact on NICU Health Discovery. 
This project is currently developing in the phase 2.


## Background and Motivation:
In the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), evaluating the recovery progress of neonates with different illnesses can be a challenging task. It is crucial to understand how quickly these neonates are recovering to provide appropriate care and interventions.

## Method:
Due to the critical role of deep sleep in the tissue repair and development of neonatal bodies, we've been working on a method to help us evaluate their progress. We're using the babies' brain activity, measured through electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. We're then applying machine learning techniques to automatically recognize different stages of sleep. This helps us figure out how much deep sleep they're getting during their entire sleep cycle.

## Challenge:
One of the main difficulties we face is identifying sleep patterns in babies who might be dealing with illnesses or discomfort. Unlike healthier babies, these little ones may not show clear and complete sleep cycles, which makes recognizing their sleep stages more complicated.

## Project Management:
This project includes 3 phases:
1. Build automatic sleep staging pipeline based on EEG open datasets
2. Model with full-term and healthy neonates EEG signals from the NICU
3. Explore into preterm neonates who might be dealing with illnesses or discomfort.
